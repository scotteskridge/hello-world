# hello-world
Woot I'm on Github, time to foobar it up

Since this is just a readme I assume I don't need to comment anything out... hmm already made a few typo's I wonder if git hub has a spell checker?

Ok tutorial Step 2 make changes to my branch. Check.

And about me, I have an EE background from the airforce workign with defencive signals intellegence and high frequency communications. Proffesioanlly I've been working in the mortgage industry for the past 15 years, but all of that will end up being on a resume. I have a wife and two duaghters, I'm insomnic unless I've given my brain a hard workout during the day, I used to competativly ball room dance, I'm a bibliophile and I can't smell.
